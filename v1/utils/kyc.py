KYC (Know Your Customer) - basic information

What is KYC?
- KYC stands for Know Your Customer (or Know Your Client). It refers to the set of policies, procedures
  and controls that financial institutions and fintech services use to verify the identity of their customers
  and assess the risk they pose.

Why KYC matters in fintech:
- Prevents identity theft, fraud, money laundering (AML), terrorist financing and other financial crimes.
- Ensures compliance with local and international regulation and helps maintain access to banking rails.
- Protects the business reputation and reduces operational and legal risk.

Core components of KYC processes:
- Customer Identification (CID): collect and verify identity information (name, date of birth, national ID,
  passport, or other government-issued documents).
- Customer Due Diligence (CDD): evaluate the customer's risk profile based on activity, geography, and
  source of funds. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) applies to higher-risk customers.
- Screening: check names and identifiers against sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEP) lists,
  adverse media and internal watchlists.
- Ongoing monitoring: review transactions and user activity for suspicious patterns; periodically update
  customer information.
- Recordkeeping and audit: retain evidence of identity verification, risk assessments, decisions and alerts
  for the legally required retention period.

Operational notes for a fintech implementation:
- Implement layered checks: document validation, automated name similarity, BIN/card checks, and transaction
  AML rules. Use risk scoring to decide whether manual review is required.
- Log decisions and provide clear error messages for integration points (APIs, webhooks).
- Maintain configurable thresholds (similarity score, transaction limits) and an escalation/approval workflow
  for manual review.

This module provides lightweight helpers related to KYC tasks (formatting amounts, card checks, name similarity,
BIN lookups and a simple transfer create helper). It is not a replacement for full regulatory compliance â€” for
production use integrate with certified KYC/AML providers and follow your jurisdiction's requirements.
